## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a **10-day phishing email investigation and executive report** developed as part of my cybersecurity analyst training.  
It provides **technical and executive-level analysis** of a targeted phishing attempt against **VitalCare Health Solutions**, including **header inspection, BEC analysis, authentication checks, attachment & URL analysis, and Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**.  

**Key Deliverables:**
- Technical phishing email analysis (header, SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks).  
- Business Email Compromise (BEC) indicator assessment.  
- Attachment and URL forensic analysis.  
- Threat intelligence report with Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).  
- Executive Report for top stakeholders.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

| Tool / Technique          | Purpose |
|---------------------------|---------|
| **MX TOOLBOX** | Email authentication & spoofing detection |
| **Header Analysis**       | Trace sender IP, Return-Path anomalies |
| **Base64 Decoding**       | Malicious attachment inspection |
| **VirusTotal & URLScan**  | URL and domain reputation analysis |

## 🚨 Key Findings

1. **Authentication Failures**  
   - SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all failed.  
   - Spoofed sender: `security@vitalcarehealthsolutions.com`.  

2. **Suspicious Infrastructure**  
   - Email sent from private IP `192.168.1.1` (not routable for email).  
   - Malicious domain `secure-vitalcare-login.com` used for credential harvesting.  

3. **Social Engineering Indicators (BEC)**  
   - Impersonation of internal security team.  
   - Subject line: “Urgent: Immediate Action Required”.  
   - Use of **urgency + authority** tactics to trick recipients.
